# John Anthony Weekend TODO List

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This is an app that will take in a a task that the user will input.
Once the task is submitted, it will be put onto a task list. On the task list
you can complete the task or you can delete the task, removing it from the list and the database.
When a task is completed it will be highlighted green to indicate you have completed this task and update in the database.

I solved this by working slowly, so I do not get lost in the code very.
I lean on my cohort and google for a majority of the issues related, however
I should continue to ask for help for guidance through the project to keep
myself on track.

Some parts of the difficulty were from setting up the 'GET', 'POST' incantations
because I would set them up and then often forget how they worked and would
have to double back to make sure it was correct instead of trusting the process.
I could have asked for more clarity on how these incantation work as well. Their
operation makes sense on how to construct it and what to look for but conceptually
its still fuzzy.

The 'PUT' and 'DELETE' incantations are time consuming and require further
trial and error to make sure they are set up correctly.

Using a dry erase board and other props assisted with the work flow
and task completion. This project is a challenge in that it takes time
to set up a work flow for your project in such a short amount of time.
Its always good to have a TODO list and way to guide your steps when you work.
In addition to all of this, you should take proper breaks because eye fatigue is
something that stall your work and cause greater problems.

Create a 'TO DO' application.
